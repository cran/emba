#' Get total biomarkers from average data differences matrix
#'
#' Use this function to find all biomarkers across multiple
#' performance classification group matchings based on a given threshold between
#' 0 and 1.
#'
#' @section Details:
#' This function uses the \code{\link{get_biomarkers_per_type}} function
#' to get the biomarkers (nodes) of both types (positive and negative) from the
#' average data differences matrix. The logic behind the biomarker selection is
#' that if there is at least one value in a column of the \code{diff.mat} matrix
#' that surpasses the threshold given, then the corresponding node (name of the
#' column) is returned as a biomarker.
#' This means that for a single node, if at least one value that represents an average data
#' difference (for example, the average activity state difference) between any
#' of the given classification group comparisons is above the given threshold
#' (or below the negative symmetric threshold), then a \emph{positive}
#' (\emph{negative}) biomarker is reported.
#'
#' In the case of a node which is found to surpass the
#' significance threshold level given \emph{both negatively and positively},
#' we will keep it as a biomarker
#' in the category which corresponds to the \strong{comparison of the highest
#' classification groups}. For example, if the data comes from a model performance
#' classification based on the MCC score and in the comparison of the MCC classes
#' (1,3) the node of interest had an average difference of \emph{-0.89} (a negative
#' biomarker) while for the comparison of the (3,4) MCC classes it had a value
#' of \emph{0.91} (a positive biomarker), then we will keep that node \emph{only as a
#' positive biomarker}. The logic behind this is that
#' the 'higher' performance-wise are the classification groups that we compare,
#' the more sure we are that the average data difference corresponds to a
#' \emph{better indicator} for the type of the biomarker found.
#'
#' @param diff.mat a matrix whose rows are vectors of average node data
#' differences between two groups of models based on some kind of classification
#' (e.g. number of TP predictions) and whose names are set in the \code{rownames}
#' attribute of the matrix (usually denoting the different classification
#' groups, e.g. (1,2) means the models that predicted 1 TP synergy vs the models
#' that predicted 2 TP synergies, if the classification is done by number of TP
#' predictions). The columns represent the network's node names.
#' @param threshold numeric. A number in the [0,1] interval, above which (or
#' below its negative value) a biomarker will be registered in the returned result.
#' Values closer to 1 translate to a more strict threshold and thus less
#' biomarkers are found.

#'  \itemize{
#'    \item \code{biomarkers.pos}: a character vector that includes the node
#'    names of the \emph{positive} biomarkers
