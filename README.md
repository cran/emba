Analysis and visualization of an ensemble of boolean models for biomarker discovery in cancer cell networks. 

The package allows to easily load the simulation data results of the [DrugLogics](https://github.com/druglogics) software pipeline that is used to predict synergistic drug combinations in cancer cell lines.
It has generic functions that can be used to split a boolean model dataset to model groups with regards to the models predictive performance (number of *true positive* predictions/*Matthews correlation coefficient* score) or synergy prediction based on a given set of *gold standard* synergies and find the average activity difference per network node between all model group pairs.
Thus, given user-specific thresholds, important nodes (*biomarkers*) can be accessed in the sense that they make the models predict specific synergies (*synergy biomarkers*) or have better performance in general (*performance biomarkers*).

Lastly, if the boolean models have a [specific equation form](https://druglogics.github.io/druglogics-doc/gitsbe-description.html#default-equation) and differ only in their link operator, *link operator* biomarkers can also be found.

## Install
